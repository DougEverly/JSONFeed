# Graphics

You can use the graphics (by [Craig Hockenberry](http://furbo.org/)) on your own site when linking to your JSON Feed. As with the familiar RSS icon, you can modify the image to suit your needs, but keep in mind that the symbol and color scheme will help people understand what you're doing.

The images are available as a PNG bitmap or as vectors in both SVG and PDF. These files were created using `jsonfeed.sketch` which can be opened with [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/).
